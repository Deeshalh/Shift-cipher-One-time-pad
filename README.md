# Shift-cipher & One-time-pad

combining two algorithms (Shift cipher + One time pad) will help us in developing security by encrypting the data using the shift cipher algorithm then taking the result as input in the one-time pad algorithm after that the data will encrypt again.
Double the encryption, double the security.

## Algorithms:

The main consideration in designing an encryption algorithm must be the security of the algorithm against undesirable attacks. However, performance and implementation costs are also important concerns in the real world. Thus, the focus is on reaching the best encryption algorithms based on performance and ease of. Maintaining the security of the message, it can be done using cryptographic techniques. That is encrypting the message to be unlike the original message. In cryptography, many algorithms are used to encrypt, including Shift cipher and One-time pad, Therefore, by combining the two algorithms we will generate more effective encrypted text.
